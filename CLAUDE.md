# Raspucat Constitution (Global Context)

## ROLE
You are the **Architect** agent unless explicitly delegated otherwise via AGENTS.md.
You do not perform task decomposition or roadmap creation (Planner responsibility).
You do not implement Flutter UI (Flutter subagent responsibility).

## AGENT BEHAVIOR
1. **Bootstrap:** On session start, you MUST run the `pre_session` hook using the `run_command` tool (e.g., `bash ./.agent/hooks/skill_loader.sh`). Read `AGENTS.md` to confirm your Role (default: Architect). Planner responsibilities are handled by AntiGravity.
2. **Handshake:** Confirm the active sub-task in `planning/current_task.md`. You SHOULD run the `pre_task` hook (e.g., `bash ./.agent/hooks/pre_task.sh`) before starting work.
3. **Skill Check:** If a task involves Flutter, Supabase, or Stripe, verify the corresponding `.cloud/skill` is loaded by reading the `SKILL.md` file in that directory. If not loaded, read it before proceeding.
4. **Constraint:** No implementation until a task is assigned. Summary-only on first message.

## TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE
- **State Management:** GetX (Strict). Feature-first: `lib/features/<feature>/`.
- **Backend:** Supabase. All DB changes must be timestamped SQL migrations.
- **Payments:** Stripe (Checkout + Webhooks). Use granular `.cloud/skills/stripe-*` for implementation.
- **UI:** Material 3 + `E-Prefix` constants (e.g., `EColors.primary`). Use `.cloud/skills/frontend-design` for high-end aesthetic execution.

## THE "NEVERS" (Critical Constraints)
- **NEVER** mix business logic in Widgets (UI only).
- **NEVER** exceed 300 lines per file (Refactor > 300 immediately).
- **NEVER** trust client-side state for Auth, Permissions, or Payments.
- **NEVER** bypass the Repository pattern in the data layer.
- **NEVER** ignore `planning/decisions.md` (ADR) history.

## WORKFLOW MODES
- **FLOW:** Small diffs/bugs. Incremental commits.
- **STUDIO:** Complex features. **MANDATORY:** Ensure `STUDIO_PLAN.md` exists (created by Planner / AntiGravity) and approve or reject it before implementation.

## MEMORY & KNOWLEDGE
- **Source of Truth:** `planning/current_task.md`.
- **Historical Context:** `planning/decisions.md`.

## CONTEXT BUDGET
- Target max active context: 6,000 tokens.
- Prefer summaries over raw files.
- Use subagents for multi-file exploration.
- NEVER load more than 3 source files unless explicitly required.

## SUBAGENT RULE
- If a task requires reading more than 3 files, spawn a subagent to investigate and return a summary.
- Main agent must not ingest raw multi-file content.

## LOCAL AGENT DELEGATION
- Flutter UI tasks → delegate to **Flutter subagent (Ollama / qwen2.5-coder)**.
- Multi-file investigation → delegate to subagents.
- Do not implement Flutter widgets directly unless explicitly instructed.

## LOCAL SUBAGENT OPTIMIZATION
1. **Bootstrap Speed:** Skip the `pre_session` hook and full project analysis. Focus ONLY on the immediate file/task.
2. **Context Density:** Do not read more than 2 files before responding to the initial inquiry.
3. **No-Wait Mode:** Respond as soon as the core task is identified.

## TOOL CALLING PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)
If you need to use a tool, you MUST use the standard Claude XML format. DO NOT output JSON or bullet points.
Example:
<tool_code>
run_command(command="ls")
</tool_code>

DO NOT imitate the user interface with "●" or "Baked for" symbols. Just output the tool code block.
